<h3 align="center">🇫🇷 IT Student and Cybersecurity Enthusiast | CTF Player</h3>

Networking & Telecommunications student, interested by multiple areas of computer science, I enjoy programming, networking and system administration (GNU/Linux and Unix 🐧). I also am a CTF player that plays with [EGO+](https://ctftime.org/team/157022), during CTF's I mainly like doing Web Application, Forensic and Networking challenges, but I also sometimes go for Crypto.
